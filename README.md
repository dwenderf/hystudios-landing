# Hudson Yards Studios — Landing

This repository contains the landing page for **Hudson Yards Studios**.

The site serves as a simple “coming soon” presence during the pre-seed phase and
provides a high-level overview of the platform, along with a controlled way for
interested parties to request the investor deck or an intro conversation.

## Stack
- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **Vercel** (deployment)
- **Resend** (contact form email delivery)

## Development

Install dependencies and run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Deployment

The application is deployed via Vercel and automatically builds from the
main branch. Environment variables are managed in the Vercel dashboard.

## Notes

This site is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to
sell or a solicitation to buy securities.

This is:
- Professional
- Minimal
- Appropriate for a fundraising-facing repo
- Easy to extend later if needed

Once this is in place, you’re perfectly set up to run `create-next-app` and start wiring everything together.
